## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- Git

### Quick Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Piyush64-bit/CPP-Programs.git
   cd CPP-Programs
   ```

2. **Open in VS Code**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Compile and run any example**
   ```bash
   g++ -o output filename.cpp
   ./output
   ```

---

## 💡 Usage

### Running Examples
Each folder contains self-contained C++ programs. Simply navigate to any topic and run:

```bash
# Example: Running a basic OOP program
cd 01_Basics
g++ -o polymorphism polymorphism.cpp
./polymorphism
```

### Learning Path Recommendation
1. Start with **01_Basics** for OOP fundamentals
2. Move to **02_AbstractDataType** for data structures
3. Explore **03_Functions&Variable** for advanced concepts
4. Practice with **10_Question** folder
5. Build the **11_Final-Project** for hands-on experience
