// OOPs
// Object Oriented Programming
// It has four parts:
// a> Polymorphism {one f(n) with many use case}
// two types
// 1. run time - method and operator overloading
// 2.compile time - method overriding
// b> Abstraction {Hiding the logic}
// c> Inheritance {Reusing properties and behaviors from a parent class}
// d> Encapsulation {Wrapping data and methods into a single unit and restricting access}


//class
// -> Public or Private or protected.
// -> by default, if you don't write public keyword it will be automatically assigned to private.
// -> every class has an object, which is a variable name.
// -> ever class has a constructor, it is a method or function which has the same name as the class name.
// -> construtor can also have thier odjects just like the class.

//STL
// -> Standard template libary
// -> it has certain features and function which are in bulit in c++ we can use them directly.
// -> for example - Stack, Quwe, Linkedlist, vector etc.
// -> most of DSA is based on this.
